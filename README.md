## PSD Files
PSD files are sliced spritesheets to be used for asset-bundles. The advantages of using an asset bundle over the regular upload is that transparency, aspect ratio and interpolation is exact.

## PNG Files
Used for certain animations or where necessary, such as GUI elements.

## unity3d files
Assetbundles to link to from ingame
